### Hi there! ðŸ˜ƒ
I'm Lilian - a final year Computer Science student. Welcome to my Github where I store the projects I've worked hard on and that I'm passionate about! ðŸ™‚

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a final year Computer Science student at Sunway University
- ðŸ’» I'm interested in machine learning, robotics, and programming ðŸ˜ƒ
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SLAM, PyTorch, and Tensorflow (also looking to learn new things that interest me!)
- ðŸ“« Reach me through my email at llianung01@gmail.com

My interest in technology (especially robotics) began at age 8 when my local mall hosted a roadshow demo of Honda's new humanoid robot called 'Asimo'. As I watched it kick a football, I was in awe. The extent of my fascination with it led me to watching every YouTube video on 'Asimo' in existence, and from then on, my dream became to build robots. 
When I was 10, I got the opportunity to build my first robot with the Lego Mindstorms robotics kit. Now 10 years later, I'm working in my university's research lab to build an industry-grade robot ðŸ™‚.
Along the way, I also developed a passion for computers and discovered that I enjoy coding (the more it gets me thinking, the better!). The fields that I find most interesting are artificial intelligence and computer vision. Hence, I'm always seeking new experiences and opportunities to learn more about both robotics and programming!
